# proj-conan


Deployments:

* Prod: <https://team02.dokku-17.cs.ucsb.edu>
* QA: <https://team02-qa.dokku-17.cs.ucsb.edu>

## Purpose


The purpose of proj-conan is to provide an open source platform to make content analysis easier.

The initial motivation is that we have a large number of text artifacts that are suitable for content analysis, including:

* Answers to reflection questions that are embedded in Gradescope exams (available as CSV downloads)
* Answers to reflection prompts on Slack (available as JSON downloads)

Traditionally, content analysis is done via either expensive purpose built tools such as InVivo, or by ad-hoc spreadsheets.  There is an opportunity for something in between that automates and streamlines the process of:

* creating and managing codes and codebooks
* selecting random subsets of data to for coding calibration rounds
* keeping track of work progress
* computing inter-rater reliability (Raw Agreement, Cohen's Kappa, Krippendorf's Alpha).

# Versions
* Java: 21
* node: 22.18.0
See [docs/versions.md](docs/versions.md) for more information on upgrading versions.

# Setup before running application

Before running the application for the first time,
you need to do the steps documented in [`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

Otherwise, when you try to login for the first time, you 
will likely see an error such as:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/149858436-c9baa238-a4f7-4c52-b995-0ed8bee97487.png" alt="Authorization Error; Error 401: invalid_client; The OAuth client was not found." width="400"/>

# Getting Started on localhost

* Open *two separate terminal windows*  
* In the first window, start up the backend with:
  ``` 
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
* In the second window:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm ci  # only on first run
  npm start
  ```

Then, the app should be available on <http://localhost:8080>

If it doesn't work at first, e.g. you have a blank page on  <http://localhost:8080>, give it a minute and a few page refreshes.  Sometimes it takes a moment for everything to settle in.

If you see the following on localhost, make sure that you also have the frontend code running in a separate window.

```
Failed to connect to the frontend server... On Dokku, be sure that PRODUCTION is defined.  On localhost, open a second terminal window, cd into frontend and type: npm install; npm start";
```

# Getting Started on Dokku

See: [/docs/dokku.md](/docs/dokku.md)

# Accessing swagger

To access the swagger API endpoints, use:

* <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html>

Or add `/swagger-ui/index.html` to the URL of your dokku deployment.

# To run React Storybook

* cd into frontend
* use: npm run storybook
* This should put the storybook on http://localhost:6006
* Additional stories are added under frontend/src/stories

For documentation on React Storybook, see: 
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/storybook/>
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/chromatic/>
* <https://storybook.js.org/>

# SQL Database access

On localhost:
* The SQL database is an H2 database and the data is stored in a file under `target`
* Each time you do `mvn clean` the database is completely rebuilt from scratch
* You can access the database console via a special route, <http://localhost:8080/h2-console>
* For more info, see [docs/h2-database.md](/docs/h2-database.md)

On Dokku, follow instructions for Dokku databases:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/dokku/postgres_database.html>

# Testing

## Unit Tests

* To run all unit tests, use: `mvn test`
* To run only the tests from `FooTests.java` use: `mvn test -Dtest=FooTests`

Unit tests are any methods labelled with the `@Test` annotation that are under the `/src/test/java` hierarchy, and have file names that end in `Test` or `Tests`

## Integration Tests

To run only the integration tests, use:
```
INTEGRATION=true mvn test-compile failsafe:integration-test
```

To run only the integration tests *and* see the tests run as you run them,
use:

```
INTEGRATION=true HEADLESS=false mvn test-compile failsafe:integration-test
```

To run a particular integration test (e.g. only `HomePageWebIT.java`) use `-Dit.test=ClassName`, for example:

```
INTEGRATION=true mvn test-compile failsafe:integration-test -Dit.test=HomePageWebIT
```

or to see it run live:
```
INTEGRATION=true HEADLESS=false mvn test-compile failsafe:integration-test -Dit.test=HomePageWebIT
```

Integration tests are any methods labelled with `@Test` annotation, that are under the `/src/test/java` hierarchy, and have names starting with `IT` (specifically capital I, capital T).

By convention, we are putting Integration tests (the ones that run with Playwright) under the package `src/test/java/edu/ucsb/cs156/example/web`.

Unless you want a particular integration test to *also* be run when you type `mvn test`, do *not* use the suffixes `Test` or `Tests` for the filename.

Note that while `mvn test` is typically sufficient to run tests, we have found that if you haven't compiled the test code yet, running `mvn failsafe:integration-test` may not actually run any of the tests.


## Partial pitest runs

This repo has support for partial pitest runs

For example, to run pitest on just one class, use:

```
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage -DtargetClasses=edu.ucsb.cs156.example.controllers.RestaurantsController
```

To run pitest on just one package, use:

```
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage -DtargetClasses=edu.ucsb.cs156.example.controllers.\*
```

To run full mutation test coverage, as usual, use:

```
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage
```
